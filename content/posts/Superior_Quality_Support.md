Sleep quality is closely linked to health, according to the Sleep Foundation, who reported that 67 percent of people who report fair or poor sleep quality had similar reports related to their health, and only 27 percent of them reporting good health. Even while reporting favorable sleep quantity, many Americans also report less than favorable sleep quality.

Choosing a natural mattress that offers sufficient comfort and support can make a huge difference in sleep quality for Americans who wake up frequently during the night, report aches and pains upon waking, or who simply are unable to get comfortable enough to get the sleep they require.

Poor sleep is a massive health issue as it correlates to a wide range of chronic illnesses and health conditions including:
<ol>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Infertility</li>
<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
<li>Chronic inflammation</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
</ol>
Also, the natural fibers in natural mattresses, like cotton and wool, regulate your body temperature while you sleep. So, you have plenty to love about the comfortable night’s sleep you’ll get with a natural mattress. Especially when compared to mattresses made with synthetic foam materials that get warm close to the skin, keeping you up at night when you’d rather be sleeping.
