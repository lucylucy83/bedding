## Highest Standards
Many mattress manufacturers claim to have toxin free products. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that those claims are unfounded.

While many mattresses make claims about how they are made and what types of materials aren’t used in the process, PlushBeds mattresses backs up their claims with various certifications. Their certifications are from respected, independent certifying agencies, including:
<ol>
<li>Global Organic Latex Standard (latex)</li>
<li>Global Organic Textile Standard (cotton and wool)</li>
<li>USDA Organic (latex, cotton, and wool)</li>
<li>GreenGuard Gold Certification</li>
<li>Oeko-Tex Standard 100</li>
<li>Eco-Institut Certification</li>
<li>Control Union Certification</li>
<li>Forest Stewardship Council Certification</li>
</ol>

PlushBeds believe that by going through the process of meeting multiple standards, they’re providing better products for you and the planet. Each certification is one more step in their process of providing quality products that are made ethically, socially consciously.

What Plushbeds' [certifications](https://www.sleepsuppliers.com/posts/plushbeds_certifications/) let you know is that they back up their claims of purity in their mattresses with rigorous internal testing and external corroboration. It means you can buy our mattresses knowing you’re getting mattresses that are not filled with chemicals and that are safe for you, your significant other, and anyone else in your family to sleep on.

The average person spends eight or more hours, sleeping in their bed, every night. When you think about it, that adds up to one-third of their lifetime. Your mattress is an intimate point of contact, and it could be a huge health risk for you and your family if you’re not using a natural mattress.
