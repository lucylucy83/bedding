## What Is Natural Latex?

Latex is a natural material derived from the sap of the rubber tree and is then transformed into latex foam used in natural latex mattresses. Sap is harvested from rubber trees, whipped into a froth and baked into the cozy latex layers that go inside your mattress. 

Top producers adhere to strict standards to ensure that their latex is 100% organic. They don’t use synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Their manufacturing methods also ensure that the purity of the final product is not compromised. Arpico latex is considered among the best natural organic latex.

<h2 id="anchor-name">Why Natural Latex</h2>

A natural latex mattress is often recommended by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists because of its buoyant feeling that gently cradles the pressure points of your body, which helps to relieve aches and pains & promote deep sleep. 

Latex mattresses offer great comfort and maximum support as they conform instantly to every movement keeping the spine and back in the correct position and relieving pressure points at the same time. Natural latex mattresses have great elasticity, yet they are very durable. A latex mattress will outlast any other conventional, pocket sprung or memory foam mattress. Once you sleep on a natural latex mattress you would not change it for anything else.

Organic latex is also:

1. [Anti-Microbial](https://www.sleepsuppliers.com/microbe-resitant-mattress) mold and mildew proof, meaning less sneezing and wheezing for allergy sufferers
2. Dust Mite Resistant, cutting down on the #1 source of your house’s indoor allergens
3. Sleeps cool, unlike heat-trapping foams
4. Has no off-putting smells or irritants

...and did we mention no toxins?

 You’ll be amazed at how well you’ll feel when you upgrade to an organic, restful sleep on a latex mattress. 

## Superior Sleep Quality and Support 

Sleep quality is closely linked to health, according to the Sleep Foundation, who reported that 67 percent of people who report fair or poor sleep quality had similar reports related to their health, and only 27 percent of them reporting good health. Even while reporting favorable sleep quantity, many Americans also report less than favorable sleep quality.

Choosing a natural mattress that offers sufficient comfort and support can make a huge difference in sleep quality for Americans who wake up frequently during the night, report aches and pains upon waking, or who simply are unable to get comfortable enough to get the sleep they require.

Poor sleep is a massive health issue as it correlates to a wide range of chronic illnesses and health conditions including:
<ol>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Infertility</li>
<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
<li>Chronic inflammation</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
</ol>


## Body Temperature Regulation

Also, the natural fibers in natural mattresses, like cotton and wool, regulate your body temperature while you sleep. So, you have plenty to love about the comfortable night’s sleep you’ll get with a natural mattress. Especially when compared to mattresses made with synthetic foam materials that get warm close to the skin, keeping you up at night when you’d rather be sleeping.


## Not All Organic Mattresses Are Created Equal

Many mattress manufacturers claim to have toxin free products. However, upon closer examination, it becomes clear that those claims are unfounded.
