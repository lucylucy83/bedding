Latex is a natural material derived from the sap of the rubber tree and is then transformed into latex foam used in natural latex mattresses. Latex mattresses offer great comfort and maximum support as they conform instantly to every movement keeping the spine and back in the correct position and relieving pressure points at the same time. Natural latex mattresses have great elasticity, yet they are very durable. A latex mattress will outlast any other conventional, pocket sprung or memory foam mattress. Once you sleep on a natural latex mattress you would not change it for anything else.

A natural latex mattress is often recommended by chiropractors and orthopedic specialists because of its buoyant feeling that gently cradles the pressure points of your body, which helps to relieve aches and pains & promote deep sleep.

Organic latex is also:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Anti-Microbial, mold and mildew proof, meaning less sneezing and wheezing for allergy sufferers</li>
<li>Dust Mite Resistant, cutting down on the #1 source of your house’s indoor allergens</li>
<li>Sleeps cool, unlike heat-trapping foams</li>
<li>Has no off-putting smells or irritants</li>
</ol>

....and did we mention no toxins?

 You’ll be amazed at how well you’ll feel when you upgrade to an organic, restful sleep on a latex mattress.
