## Bacteria In Your Mattress Is There For Good 

Believe it or not, you bring some illnesses to bed with you at night. Things you’re exposed to throughout the day that may not affect you right away can be sweated out into your mattress while you sleep, and trapped there indefinitely. 

The germs seep through your sheets and even through waterproof mattress protectors. So even when you wash your bed sheets regularly, what seeped into your mattress remains there. 

## Why Antibacterial Mattress Spray Isn't Enough

Antibacterial mattress sprays only address the germs that are sitting on surface of the mattress and does not address what goes on in the deeper layers of the mattress. Reaching the deeper layers would require saturing the mattress with moisture, which isn't a good idea because it can lead to mildew. 

## A Natural Mattress Is Microbe Resitant

Viruses, bacteria, and more can linger deep inside the folds of traditional mattresses waiting for the time to cause havoc in your life.

That isn’t the case with natural mattresses that are antimicrobial by nature, like natural latex mattresses. Additionally, [natural latex](https://sleepsuppliers.com/posts/latex-mattress) is mold and mildew resistant, antibacterial, and it repels dust mites. This helps alleviate symptoms of allergies and asthma in many people, on top of the other health benefits it delivers.

When it comes to natural latex, it is the botanical foam from the Hevea Brasiliensis tree that gives it the properties that makes it naturally resistant to so many things. The good news for you is that it helps to promote better health for you in the process.

So if whether your want to improve your overall health, help aleviate allergies or potentially prevent illnesses, a natural mattress is the way to go! PlushBeds [natural mattresses](https://bestbeds.sale/organic) are an excellent choice of independently certified organic mattresses and are great value for money.
