The average person spends eight or more hours, sleeping in their bed, every night. When you think about it, that adds up to one-third of their lifetime. Your mattress is an intimate point of contact, and it could be a huge health risk for you and your family if you’re not using a natural mattress.
<br><br>

<h2>Absence of Toxic Chemicals</h2>
<br>
Some mattresses on the market today, contain chemicals that can have toxic effects on humans, when they off-gas. The list of chemicals is long, and contains many of the following:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Boric acid</li>
<li>Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)</li>
<li>Formaldehyde</li>
<li>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)</li>
<li>Benzene</li>
<li>Toluene</li>
<li>Chromium</li>
<li>Mercury</li>
<li>Nickel</li>
</ol>

These are all things you certainly don’t want to expose yourself or your family to for eight hours or more every night. Natural mattresses, like any mattress from the 
<a href="https://bit.ly/organiclatexmattress">Natural Latex Mattress</a> Collection at PlushBeds, contain none of these harmful ingredients. So, you’re not risking your family’s health just by going to sleep at night. That’s something that should help you rest easier.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Microbe Resistance</h2>
<br>
Believe it or not, you bring some illnesses to bed with you at night. Things you’re exposed to throughout the day that may not affect you right away can be sweated out into your mattress while you sleep, and trapped there indefinitely. Viruses, bacteria, and more can linger deep inside the folds of traditional mattresses waiting for the time to cause havoc in your life.
<br>
<br>
That isn’t the case with natural mattresses that are antimicrobial by nature, like natural latex mattresses. Additionally, <a href="https://sleepsuppliers.com/posts/latex-mattress">natural latex</a> is mold and mildew resistant, antibacterial, and it repels dust mites. This helps alleviate symptoms of allergies and asthma in many people, on top of the other health benefits it delivers.
<br>
<br>
When it comes to natural latex, it is the botanical foam from the Hevea Brasiliensis tree that gives it the properties that makes it naturally resistant to so many things. The good news for you is that it helps to promote better health for you in the process.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Superior Quality and Support</h2>
<br>
Sleep quality is closely linked to health, according to the Sleep Foundation, who reported that 67 percent of people who report fair or poor sleep quality had similar reports related to their health, and only 27 percent of them reporting good health. Even while reporting favorable sleep quantity, many Americans also report less than favorable sleep quality.

Choosing a natural mattress that offers sufficient comfort and support can make a huge difference in sleep quality for Americans who wake up frequently during the night, report aches and pains upon waking, or who simply are unable to get comfortable enough to get the sleep they require.

Poor sleep is a massive health issue as it correlates to a wide range of chronic illnesses and health conditions including:
<br>
<br>

<ol>
<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>Heart disease</li>
<li>Infertility</li>
<li>Sexual dysfunction</li>
<li>Chronic inflammation</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>High blood pressure</li>
</ol>
Also, the natural fibers in natural mattresses, like cotton and wool, regulate your body temperature while you sleep. So, you have plenty to love about the comfortable night’s sleep you’ll get with a natural mattress. Especially when compared to mattresses made with synthetic foam materials that get warm close to the skin, keeping you up at night when you’d rather be sleeping.
