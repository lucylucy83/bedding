<h2>Highest Standards</h2>
<br>
While many mattresses make claims about how they are made and what types of materials aren’t used in the process, PlushBeds mattresses backs up their claims with various certifications. Our certifications are from respected, independent certifying agencies, including:
<br>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Global Organic Latex Standard (latex)</li>
<li>Global Organic Textile Standard (cotton and wool)</li>
<li>USDA Organic (latex, cotton, and wool)</li>
<li>GreenGuard Gold Certification</li>
<li>Oeko-Tex Standard 100</li>
<li>Eco-Institut Certification</li>
<li>Control Union Certification</li>
<li>Forest Stewardship Council Certification</li>
</ol>
<br>
We believe that by going through the process of meeting multiple standards, we’re providing better products for you, our customers, and the planet. Each certification is one more step in our process of providing quality products that are made ethically, socially conscious, and with safeguarding the planet and the people who call it home as our primary priority.
<br>
<br>
What our certifications let you know is that we back up our claims of purity in our mattresses with rigorous internal testing and external corroboration. It means you can buy our mattresses knowing you’re getting mattresses that are not filled with chemicals and that are safe for you, your significant other, and anyone else in your family to sleep on.
