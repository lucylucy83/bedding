Sleepsuppliers.com is passionate about helping you make better choices when it comes to your sleep health. We want you to have access to the best truly independently certified organic mattresses. We’ve scoured the globe in an effort to introduce you to the best sleep products and get you the best deals.

We are proud to announce to our readers that we’ve secured a special discount with one of the top independently certified mattress manufacturers!

They are proud recipients of the [GreenGuard Gold](http://greenguard.org/en/index.aspx?mobile=true) Certification, a certification that less than 1% of all mattresses receive due to the world's most rigorous chemical emissions standards. This is in addition their GOLS, GOTS, USDA Organic, OEKO-TEX certifications and further certifications.

We chose them not only for their truly organic mattresses, but also for the countless positive feedback from existing clients. Here is just one example:
