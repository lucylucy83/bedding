# Certifications and Tests

PlushBeds is committed to providing you with the best and most healthy sleep products on the market. In order to achieve this, we ensure that our products and our business meet the high standards of the most rigorous tests and certifications in the industry. Learn more about all of our certifications below.

## Safety and Sustainability Standards

#### Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS)

<img src="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certifications/Certifications_05.jpg" alt="PlushBeds" class="TextWrapLeft"> 

The Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is the materials and processing standard for organic latex and finished organic latex foam. In addition to certifying that the latex itself is organic, GOLS also certifies that the production and manufacturing processes meet standards for human health, safety and welfare, as well as environmental standards. The PlushBeds Botanical Bliss collection and Organic Shredded Latex pillow are made from GOLS certified organic latex.

#### GOTS Certified Organic Cotton

<img src="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certifications/Certifications_04.jpg" alt="PlushBeds" class="TextWrapLeft"> 

High levels of agrochemicals are used in the production of conventional cotton. In fact, non-organic cotton production uses more pesticides per unit area than any other crop. Because we spend 1/3 of our lives sleeping, surrounded by our sheets and bedding, it's critical that we choose these materials thoughtfully. As a bonus, organic cotton is much, much softer than conventional cotton. It's because of these many benefits that we've opted to use it throughout our product line, including in our Botanical Bliss and Natural Bliss mattresses.

#### GOTS Certified Organic Wool

<img src="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certifications/Certifications_04.jpg" alt="PlushBeds" class="TextWrapLeft"> 

The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is recognized as the world's premier processing standard for organic textiles. The GOTS standard defines strict human safety, environmental safety, and social criteria standards for the entire textile supply chain and production process. All chemicals and dyes that are used throughout the entire production process must meet stringent environmental and toxicological criteria. Certified organic by the Global Organic Textile Standard, our wool is manufactured using the best practices in environment and social responsibility.

#### USDA Organic
<img src="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certifications/Certifications_03.jpg" alt="PlushBeds" class="TextWrapLeft"> 

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) sets and enforces legal standards for using the term "organic", ensuring that the production of Certified Organic materials are grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides and antibiotics, that can be harmful to humans and the environment. You'll sometimes see other companies advertising their mattresses as "organic" even when they're not. Make sure the retailer can provide you with the necessary documentation to prove that the product is indeed Certified Organic.
