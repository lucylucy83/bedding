The Global Organic Latex Standard (GOLS) is the materials and processing standard for organic latex and finished organic latex foam. In addition to certifying that the latex itself is organic, GOLS also certifies that the production and manufacturing processes meet standards for human health, safety and welfare, as well as environmental standards.

<p><img src="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certifications/Certifications_04.jpg" alt="PlushBeds" class="TextWrapLeft"></p>

<p>High levels of agrochemicals are used in the production of conventional cotton. In fact, non-organic cotton production uses more pesticides per unit area than any other crop. Because we spend <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of our lives sleeping, surrounded by our sheets and bedding, it&rsquo;s critical that we choose these materials thoughtfully. As a bonus, organic cotton is much, much softer than conventional cotton. It&rsquo;s because of these many benefits that PlushBeds have opted to use it throughout their product line, including in their Botanical Bliss and Natural Bliss mattresses. <a href="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/certification/2020-GOTS-PlushBeds.pdf">GOTS Cotton Certificate</a></p>

Certified organic by the Global Organic Textile Standard, PlushBeds&rsquo; wool is manufactured using the best practices in environment and social responsibility. <a href="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/certification/GOTS-Organic-Wool-19.pdf">GOTS Wool Certificate</a></p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) sets and enforces legal standards for using the term &ldquo;organic&rdquo;, ensuring that the production of Certified Organic materials are grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as pesticides and antibiotics, that can be harmful to humans and the environment. You&rsquo;ll sometimes see other companies advertising their mattresses as &ldquo;organic&rdquo; even when they&rsquo;re not. Make sure the retailer can provide you with the necessary documentation to prove that the product is indeed Certified Organic. <a href="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certificates/GOLS-watermark_03.pdf">GOLS Latex</a> <a href="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certificates/organiccotton.pdf">GOTS Cotton</a> <a href="https://www.plushbeds.com/assets/images/images_certificates/GOTSOrganicWool2019.pdf">GOTS Wool</a></p>
